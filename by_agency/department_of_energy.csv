Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis.

To grow, an ecosystem's plants   use sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide and the moisture available to their roots. They also release some carbon   dioxide back into the atmosphere. NASA's AirMOSS radar measures root-zone soil moisture to help determine the overall   carbon exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Flying on a Gulfstream-III (G-III) aircraft, AirMOSS will use   radar to collect soil moisture data from nine climatic habitats in North America to estimate how much carbon the   continent is taking in or releasing to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has an important influence on climate, and the   AirMOSS results will help to improve the accuracy of climate projections for the next 50-100 years. AirMOSS is part   of NASA's Earth Ventures 1 program.","AirMOSS, AIRMOSS, EOSDIS",,,,,,,,,en-us,,False,False,False,https://airmoss.ornl.gov/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,False,https://airmoss.ornl.gov/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0

We work to develop new catalysts that enable more efficient chemical reactions, discover new ways to convert plants to biofuels, understand how solvents affect chemical reactions, and how molecules diffuse on surfaces and through tiny pores. Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis.

QEW 1 Job Safety Plan The new QEW 1 Job Safety Plan (JSP) is now available for use. This easy-to-use JSP captures hazards and controls which are common for QEW 1 level work. Remember, a written Job Safety Plan is required for all electrical work at the Laboratory that involves exposure to electrical hazards. Download and complete the QEW 1 JSP with Adobe Fill & Sign! Electrical Safety Manual, Revision  2 Revision 2, dated 11/25/2019, of the LBNL Electrical Safety Manual is now in place.   This revision is  updated to the 2018 NFPA 70E, recent EFCOG best practices, and other improvements identified by the Electrical Safety Committee.  These include: Incorporates risk assessment terminology, job safety plans and human performance guidelines for Risk Management Added DC arc flash requirements and calculator tool Revised switching rules Added Guidelines and requirements on overdutied panels Added section on Automatic Voltage Testers Added Guidelines on Look-Alike Equipment, Lasers, Welders, and Vaults & Manholes Modifications to Capacitors to match EFCOG submittal to NFPA 70E-2021, and the DOE Electrical Safety Handbook The Electrical Safety Manual is an exhaustive resource that provides the rules and direction for all electrical work at LBNL to keep everyone safe from electrical hazards and meet the requirements of the applicable codes and standards.  Click to download.   Submit Feedback The Electrical Safety Program needs your input and suggestions!   ",,2023-12-05T21:30:12.000Z,http://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/09/qew-jsp-google-form-252x300.png,website,https://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/,https://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/,en-US,,False,True,False,https://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/robots.txt,True,200.0,text/plain,181.0,,"[""http://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/sitemap_index.xml""]",False,True,https://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/sitemap_index.xml,True,200.0,text/xml,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0

We work to develop new catalysts that enable more efficient chemical reactions, discover new ways to convert plants to biofuels, understand how solvents affect chemical reactions, and how molecules diffuse on surfaces and through tiny pores. Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis. Basic research conducted within the CBS is performed primarily through funding provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Basic Energy Sciences.
