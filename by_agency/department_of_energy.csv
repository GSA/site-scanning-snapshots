We work to develop new catalysts that enable more efficient chemical reactions, discover new ways to convert plants to biofuels, understand how solvents affect chemical reactions, and how molecules diffuse on surfaces and through tiny pores. Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis.

To grow, an ecosystem's plants   use sunlight, atmospheric carbon dioxide and the moisture available to their roots. They also release some carbon   dioxide back into the atmosphere. NASA's AirMOSS radar measures root-zone soil moisture to help determine the overall   carbon exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Flying on a Gulfstream-III (G-III) aircraft, AirMOSS will use   radar to collect soil moisture data from nine climatic habitats in North America to estimate how much carbon the   continent is taking in or releasing to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has an important influence on climate, and the   AirMOSS results will help to improve the accuracy of climate projections for the next 50-100 years.

Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis.

Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis.
