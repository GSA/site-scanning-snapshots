Electrical Safety Manual, Revision  2 Revision 2, dated 11/25/2019, of the LBNL Electrical Safety Manual is now in place.   This revision is  updated to the 2018 NFPA 70E, recent EFCOG best practices, and other improvements identified by the Electrical Safety Committee.  These include: Incorporates risk assessment terminology, job safety plans and human performance guidelines for Risk Management Added DC arc flash requirements and calculator tool Revised switching rules Added Guidelines and requirements on overdutied panels Added section on Automatic Voltage Testers Added Guidelines on Look-Alike Equipment, Lasers, Welders, and Vaults & Manholes Modifications to Capacitors to match EFCOG submittal to NFPA 70E-2021, and the DOE Electrical Safety Handbook The Electrical Safety Manual is an exhaustive resource that provides the rules and direction for all electrical work at LBNL to keep everyone safe from electrical hazards and meet the requirements of the applicable codes and standards.  Click to download.   Submit Feedback The Electrical Safety Program needs your input and suggestions!   ",,2024-07-18T20:36:58.000Z,http://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2022/09/qew-jsp-google-form-252x300.png,website,https://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/,https://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/,en-US,,False,True,False,https://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/robots.txt,True,200.0,text/plain,181.0,,"[""http://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/sitemap_index.xml""]",False,True,https://electricalsafety.lbl.gov/sitemap_index.xml,True,200.0,text/xml,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0

Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis.

During this APS-U dark period the BioCAT beamline is unavailable for x-ray experiments. We anticipate resuming user experiments in late 2024/early 2025.

We work to develop new catalysts that enable more efficient chemical reactions, discover new ways to convert plants to biofuels, understand how solvents affect chemical reactions, and how molecules diffuse on surfaces and through tiny pores. Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis.

Developing new instruments is also at the heart of our research. Understanding Nature's fundamental building blocks requires us to be able to see things at tiny length scales and fast time scales. We are at the cutting edge of developing tools and methods for understanding what drives biological and chemical processes; we are leaders in the fields of mass spectrometric imaging, solid state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and single particle analysis.
