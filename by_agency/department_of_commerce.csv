The...,,Interoperable Randomness Beacons | CSRC | CSRC,"The Interoperable Randomness Beacons project at NIST intends to promote the availability of trusted public randomness as a public utility. This can be used for example for auditability and transparency of services that depend on randomized processes.  The project is spearheaded by the Cryptographic Technology Group in the Computer Security Division of the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), and has counted with the participation of many collaborators over the years.  WARNING: Do NOT use Beacon generated values as cryptographic secret keys!  Randomness pulses from the NIST Randomness Beacon can be found in the NIST Beacon webpage  NIST recommendations on (pseudo)random-bit generation can be found in the NIST RBG project webpage      Historical notes      Collaborators: Ron Rivest played an important early role in motivating the creation of the project, by pointing out to NIST that a public source of randomness could be valuable for auditing voting machines.
