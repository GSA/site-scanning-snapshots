Community participation is a great strength for SCAP, because the security automation community ensures the broadest possible range of use cases is reflected in SCAP functionality. This Web site is provided to support continued community involvement. From this site, you will find information about both existing SCAP specifications and emerging specifications relevant to NIST's security automation agenda. You are invited to participate, whether monitoring community dialog or leading more substantive activities like specification authorship.  NIST's security automation agenda is broader than the vulnerability management application of modern day SCAP. Many different security activities and disciplines can benefit from standardized expression and reporting. We envision further expansion in compliance, remediation, and network monitoring, and encourage your contribution relative to these...",2016-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,2024-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,,article,https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/security-content-automation-protocol/,,en-us,,False,False,True,https://csrc.nist.gov/errors/page-not-found,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://csrc.nist.gov/errors/page-not-found,False,404.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner""]",True,20.0,9.0,20.0,v3.7.1,100.0,169.0
