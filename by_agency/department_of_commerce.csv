Activity detection has been an active research area in computer vision in recent years. The ability to detect human activities is an important task in computer vision due to its potential in a wide range of applications such as public safety and security, crime  prevention, traffic monitoring and control, eldercare/childcare, human-computer interaction, human-robot interaction, smart homes, hospital activity monitoring, and many more. Here, by activity detection, we mean the detection of visual events (people/objects engaged in particular activities) in a large collection of video data.
