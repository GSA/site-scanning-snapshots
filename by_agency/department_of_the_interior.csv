The refuge was established in 1984 to protect the rare pocosin wetlands and their associated wildlife. Pocosin wetlands grow on thick layers of peat and have stunted, shrubby vegetation. The refuge also protects swamp forest and is fringed with marsh. The vast protected area supports large populations of black bear, wintering waterfowl, river otter, and other wildlife species. In addition, the refuge is one of the only places in the world where you may see endangered red wolves in the wild.",,,https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_1200x630/public/banner_images/2021-11/black-bear-distant-on-road-usfws.JPG?h=0dc2b7e8&itok=PlE7Wsro,article,https://www.fws.gov/refuge/alligator-river,https://www.fws.gov/refuge/alligator-river,en,,False,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/alligatorriver/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/alligatorriver/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"[""usa-banner"",""usa-button"",""usa-checkbox"",""usa-fieldset"",""usa-form"",""usa-form-group"",""usa-icon"",""usa-input"",""usa-label"",""usa-legend"",""usa-prose"",""usa-skipnav"",""usa-sr-only"",""usa-textarea""]",False,75.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,75.0,dns_resolution_error,,,

Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge spans almost two million acres and covers more than 2/3rds of Kodiak Island, part of Afognak Island, and all of Ban and Uganik Islands. Spruce forests blanket lowlands in the northeastern third of Kodiak archipelago, while to the southwest, tundra prevails. A backbone of mountains rising over 4,000 feet runs the length of Kodiak Island. Within Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, you'll never be more than 15 miles from the Pacific Ocean. Here, Kodiak brown bears gorge on salmon and mountains rise 4,000 feet from craggy coastlines, misty fiords, and deep glacial valleys. Birds are prolific. Kodiak's climate is marine-influenced and characterized by moderately heavy precipitation, cool temperatures, and cloudy days. However, breaks in the weather are stunning.",,Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge,"Homeland of the Alutiiq Sugpiaq peoples, Kodiak Archipelago is located in the Gulf of Alaska, 30 miles from the nearest mainland coast, across the notoriously temperamental Shelikof Strait. Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge spans almost two million acres and covers more than 2/3rds of Kodiak Island, part of Afognak Island, and all of Ban and Uganik Islands. Spruce forests blanket lowlands in the northeastern third of Kodiak archipelago, while to the southwest, tundra prevails. A backbone of mountains rising over 4,000 feet runs the length of Kodiak Island. Within Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, you'll never be more than 15 miles from the Pacific Ocean.

The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument on EO-1 was used to validate and demonstrate technology for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). The original EO-1 Mission was successfully completed in November 2001. As the end of the Mission approached, the remote sensing research and scientific communities expressed high interest in continued acquisition of image data from EO-1. Based on this user interest and willingness to assist in funding continued operations, an agreement was reached between NASA and the United States Geological Survey to allow continuation of the EO-1 Program as an Extended Mission. The EO-1 Extended Mission is chartered to collect and distribute ALI multispectral and Hyperion hyperspectral products in response to Data Acquisition Requests (DARs). Under the Extended Mission provisions, image data acquired by EO-1 are archived and distributed by the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and placed in the public domain.",EO1,,,,,,,,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,en,,True,False,True,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,False,403.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,False,403.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner"",""usa-banner-inner"",""usa-button"",""usa-checkbox"",""usa-fieldset"",""usa-footer"",""usa-form"",""usa-form-group"",""usa-header"",""usa-icon"",""usa-input"",""usa-label"",""usa-legend"",""usa-list"",""usa-megamenu"",""usa-nav-container"",""usa-prose"",""usa-social-link"",""usa-sr-only"",""usa-textarea""]",True,80.0,1.0,20.0,v3.9.0,100.0,261.0,dns_resolution_error,,,
