Russell National Wildlife Refuge,"Encompassing approximately 1.1 million acres, Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge is the second largest national wildlife refuge in the lower 48 states. Given the size and remoteness of Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, the area has changed very little from the historic voyage of the Lewis and Clark expedition, through the era of outlaws and homesteaders, to the present time. Visitors will find spectacular examples of native prairie, forested coulees, river bottoms, and ""breaks"" badlands so often portrayed in the paintings of the colorful artist for whom this refuge is named.",False,https://www.fws.gov/cmr/robots.txt,False,False,True,404.0,text/html,,,,https://www.fws.gov/cmr/sitemap.xml,False,False,True,404.0,text/html,,,,"[""6659.global.siteimproveanalytics.io"",""a.tile.openstreetmap.org"",""b.tile.openstreetmap.org"",""bam.nr-data.net"",""c.tile.openstreetmap.org"",""cdnjs.cloudflare.com"",""dap.digitalgov.gov"",""fonts.googleapis.com"",""fonts.gstatic.com"",""js-agent.newrelic.com"",""services.arcgis.com"",""siteimproveanalytics.com"",""touchpoints.app.cloud.gov"",""www.google-analytics.com"",""www.googletagmanager.com""]",15.0,True,"["".fws.gov""]",,,,True,True,"{""agency"":""DOI"",""subagency"":""USFWS""}"
