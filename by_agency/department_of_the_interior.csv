Federal Duck Stamps are conservation revenue stamps; 98 percent of the purchase prices goes directly to help acquire and protect wetland habitat and purchase conservation easements for the National Wildlife Refuge System. Wetlands acquired with Duck Stamp dollars help purify water, aid in flood control, reduce soil erosion and sedimentation, and enhance outdoor recreation opportunities.  One Stamp, Many Uses While waterfowl hunters 16 years of age or older are required to purchase them, anyone can contribute to conservation by buying Duck Stamps. In addition to serving as hunting license and conservation tool, a current Federal Duck Stamp is also a free pass into any national wildlife refuge national wildlife refuge A national wildlife refuge is typically a contiguous area of land and water managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  for the conservation and, where appropriate, restoration of fish, wildlife and plant resources and their habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Learn more about national wildlife refuge that charges an entry fee. Because nearly all of the proceeds are used to conserve habitat for birds and other wildlife, birders, nature photographers and other outdoor enthusiasts buy Duck Stamps to help ensure that they can always see wildlife at their favorite outdoor spots. Federal Duck Stamps are sold at many sporting goods stores and other retail locations - both large and small - that sell sporting and recreation equipment. You can also buy them at many national wildlife refuges, and online through Amplex. As an added convenience, especially for hunters, the E-Stamp program allows you to buy a Duck Stamp online and instantly obtain a printable receipt good for 45 days,",Duck Stamps,,,,https://www.fws.gov/service/duck-stamps,False,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/duckstamps/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/duckstamps/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,50.0

The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument on EO-1 was used to validate and demonstrate technology for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). The original EO-1 Mission was successfully completed in November 2001. As the end of the Mission approached, the remote sensing research and scientific communities expressed high interest in continued acquisition of image data from EO-1. Based on this user interest and willingness to assist in funding continued operations, an agreement was reached between NASA and the United States Geological Survey to allow continuation of the EO-1 Program as an Extended Mission. The EO-1 Extended Mission is chartered to collect and distribute ALI multispectral and Hyperion hyperspectral products in response to Data Acquisition Requests (DARs). Under the Extended Mission provisions, image data acquired by EO-1 are archived and distributed by the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and placed in the public domain.",,,,,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,True,False,True,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,True,200.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,60.0,1.0,20.0,v2.12.2,100.0,241.0
