The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument on EO-1 was used to validate and demonstrate technology for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). The original EO-1 Mission was successfully completed in November 2001. As the end of the Mission approached, the remote sensing research and scientific communities expressed high interest in continued acquisition of image data from EO-1. Based on this user interest and willingness to assist in funding continued operations, an agreement was reached between NASA and the United States Geological Survey to allow continuation of the EO-1 Program as an Extended Mission. The EO-1 Extended Mission is chartered to collect and distribute ALI multispectral and Hyperion hyperspectral products in response to Data Acquisition Requests (DARs). Under the Extended Mission provisions, image data acquired by EO-1 are archived and distributed by the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) and placed in the public domain.",EO1,,,,,,,,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,en,,True,False,True,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/earth-observing-1-eo-1,True,200.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner"",""usa-banner-inner"",""usa-button"",""usa-checkbox"",""usa-fieldset"",""usa-footer"",""usa-form"",""usa-header"",""usa-icon"",""usa-input"",""usa-label"",""usa-legend"",""usa-list"",""usa-megamenu"",""usa-nav-container"",""usa-prose"",""usa-social-link"",""usa-sr-only"",""usa-textarea""]",True,80.0,1.0,20.0,v3.9.0,100.0,261.0

An estimated 1,000,000 trout weighing 275,000 pounds are produced each year. These fish provide over $50 million dollars per year in direct economic benefits. These fish are stocked in coordination with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources in over 125 public fishing waters within the commonwealth of Kentucky.",,,https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_1200x630/public/banner_images/2021-11/hatchery%20photo%202%20.JPG?h=17e91567&itok=bWlhu9IT,article,https://www.fws.gov/fish-hatchery/wolf-creek,https://www.fws.gov/fish-hatchery/wolf-creek,en,,False,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/wolfcreek/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"[""usa-banner"",""usa-button"",""usa-checkbox"",""usa-fieldset"",""usa-form"",""usa-icon"",""usa-input"",""usa-label"",""usa-legend"",""usa-prose"",""usa-skipnav"",""usa-sr-only"",""usa-textarea""]",False,75.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,75.0

For thousands of years, this area has been—and continues as—a homeland for Gwich’in and Koyukon Athabascan people.",,,https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_1200x630/public/banner_images/2021-12/Yukon%20flats%20lidar%20small.jpg?h=53d33503&itok=9D8MU2jI,article,https://www.fws.gov/refuge/yukon-flats,https://www.fws.gov/refuge/yukon-flats,en,,False,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/refuge/yukon_flats/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/refuge/yukon_flats/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"[""usa-banner"",""usa-button"",""usa-checkbox"",""usa-fieldset"",""usa-form"",""usa-icon"",""usa-input"",""usa-label"",""usa-legend"",""usa-prose"",""usa-skipnav"",""usa-sr-only"",""usa-textarea""]",False,75.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,75.0

The heart of the refuge is Izembek Lagoon, a coastal ecosystem that's home to one of the world's largest eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds. Hundreds of thousands of waterfowl, including virtually the entire population of Pacific black brant, visit the lagoon to feed on eelgrass and rest during migration. From brown bears to Pacific salmon, more than 200 species call this refuge home.

Coordination among all these stakeholders is a challenge, and having a centralized location where researchers and managers can identify relevant scientific activities and access fundamental information about these activities is crucial for efficient management. The Science in the Great Lakes (SiGL) Mapper was a map-based discovery tool that spatially displayed basin-wide multidisciplinary monitoring and research activities conducted by both USGS and partners from all five Great Lakes. It was designed to help Great Lakes researchers and managers strategically plan, implement, and analyze monitoring and restoration activities by providing easy access to historical and on-going project metadata while allowing them to identify gaps (spatially and topically) that have been underrepresented in previous efforts or need further study. SiGL provided a user-friendly and efficient way to explore Great Lakes projects and data through robust search options while also providing a critical spatial perspective through its interactive mapping interface.","USGS Science Data Catalog (SDC), biota, surface water (non-marine), water sampling, datasets, data release, Great Lakes, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Ontario, Canada, Michigan, Aquatic Biology, Ecology, Environmental Health, Hydrology, Information Sciences, Limnology, Sedimentology, Water Quality, Water Resources,",,,,,,,,,en-US,,False,False,True,https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/632a1b9ad34e71c6d67b908d,True,200.0,text/html,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0

These groups are distinguishable by their attitudes and preferences regarding public uses, such as motorized recreation and logging.

Federal Duck Stamps are conservation revenue stamps; 98 percent of the purchase prices goes directly to help acquire and protect wetland habitat and purchase conservation easements for the National Wildlife Refuge System. Wetlands acquired with Duck Stamp dollars help purify water, aid in flood control, reduce soil erosion and sedimentation, and enhance outdoor recreation opportunities.  One Stamp, Many Uses While waterfowl hunters 16 years of age or older are required to purchase them, anyone can contribute to conservation by buying Duck Stamps. In addition to serving as hunting license and conservation tool, a current Federal Duck Stamp is also a free pass into any national wildlife refuge national wildlife refuge A national wildlife refuge is typically a contiguous area of land and water managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  for the conservation and, where appropriate, restoration of fish, wildlife and plant resources and their habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Learn more about national wildlife refuge that charges an entry fee. Because nearly all of the proceeds are used to conserve habitat for birds and other wildlife, birders, nature photographers and other outdoor enthusiasts buy Duck Stamps to help ensure that they can always see wildlife at their favorite outdoor spots. Federal Duck Stamps are sold at many sporting goods stores and other retail locations - both large and small - that sell sporting and recreation equipment. You can also buy them at many national wildlife refuges, and online through Amplex. As an added convenience, especially for hunters, the E-Stamp program allows you to buy a Duck Stamp online and instantly obtain a printable receipt good for 45 days,",,Duck Stamps,,,,https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_1200x630/public/banner_images/2022-06/Federal%20Duck%20Stamp%20Contest.jpg?h=fa809f6e&itok=tPt-0Xc2,,https://www.fws.gov/service/duck-stamps,https://www.fws.gov/service/duck-stamps,en,,False,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/duckstamps/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/duckstamps/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"[""usa-banner"",""usa-button"",""usa-fieldset"",""usa-form"",""usa-icon"",""usa-label"",""usa-legend"",""usa-prose"",""usa-skipnav"",""usa-textarea""]",False,50.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,50.0
