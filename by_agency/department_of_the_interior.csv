Federal Duck Stamps are conservation revenue stamps; 98 percent of the purchase prices goes directly to help acquire and protect wetland habitat and purchase conservation easements for the National Wildlife Refuge System. Wetlands acquired with Duck Stamp dollars help purify water, aid in flood control, reduce soil erosion and sedimentation, and enhance outdoor recreation opportunities.  One Stamp, Many Uses While waterfowl hunters 16 years of age or older are required to purchase them, anyone can contribute to conservation by buying Duck Stamps. In addition to serving as hunting license and conservation tool, a current Federal Duck Stamp is also a free pass into any national wildlife refuge national wildlife refuge A national wildlife refuge is typically a contiguous area of land and water managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  for the conservation and, where appropriate, restoration of fish, wildlife and plant resources and their habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Learn more about national wildlife refuge that charges an entry fee. Because nearly all of the proceeds are used to conserve habitat for birds and other wildlife, birders, nature photographers and other outdoor enthusiasts buy Duck Stamps to help ensure that they can always see wildlife at their favorite outdoor spots. Federal Duck Stamps are sold at many sporting goods stores and other retail locations - both large and small - that sell sporting and recreation equipment. You can also buy them at many national wildlife refuges, and online through Amplex. As an added convenience, especially for hunters, the E-Stamp program allows you to buy a Duck Stamp online and instantly obtain a printable receipt good for 45 days,",,Duck Stamps,,,,https://www.fws.gov/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_1200x630/public/banner_images/2022-06/Federal%20Duck%20Stamp%20Contest.jpg?h=fa809f6e&itok=UDy8K_KC,,https://www.fws.gov/service/duck-stamps,https://www.fws.gov/service/duck-stamps,en,,False,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/duckstamps/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.fws.gov/duckstamps/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,50.0

Coordination among all these stakeholders is a challenge, and having a centralized location where researchers and managers can identify relevant scientific activities and access fundamental information about these activities is crucial for efficient management. The Science in the Great Lakes (SiGL) Mapper was a map-based discovery tool that spatially displayed basin-wide multidisciplinary monitoring and research activities conducted by both USGS and partners from all five Great Lakes. It was designed to help Great Lakes researchers and managers strategically plan, implement, and analyze monitoring and restoration activities by providing easy access to historical and on-going project metadata while allowing them to identify gaps (spatially and topically) that have been underrepresented in previous efforts or need further study. SiGL provided a user-friendly and efficient way to explore Great Lakes projects and data through robust search options while also providing a critical spatial perspective through its interactive mapping interface.","USGS Science Data Catalog (SDC), biota, surface water (non-marine), water sampling, datasets, data release, Great Lakes, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Ontario, Canada, Michigan, Aquatic Biology, Ecology, Environmental Health, Hydrology, Information Sciences, Limnology, Sedimentology, Water Quality, Water Resources,",,,,,,,,,en-US,,False,False,True,https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/632a1b9ad34e71c6d67b908d,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/632a1b9ad34e71c6d67b908d,True,200.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0
