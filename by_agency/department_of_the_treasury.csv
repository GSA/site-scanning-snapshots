Of that, the following amounts were committed through TARP's five program areas:Approximately $250 billion was committed in programs to stabilize banking institutions ($5 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).Approximately $27 billion was committed through programs to restart credit markets.Approximately $82 billion was committed to stabilize the U.S. auto industry ($2 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).Approximately $70 billion was committed to stabilize American International Group (AIG) ($2 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).Approximately $46 billion was committed for programs to help struggling families avoid foreclosure, with these expenditures being made over time.The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established OFS within the Office of Domestic Finance at the Department of the Treasury to implement TARP. OFS was not envisioned as a permanent organization. The authority to make new commitments through TARP ended October 3, 2010, at which time Treasury shifted focus to the orderly wind-down of TARP. As of September 30, 2023, all TARP programs have closed, and there are no remaining troubled assets held by OFS. During fiscal year 2023, OFS completed the wind down of its remaining housing programs under TARP and sold its last troubled assets from the Capital Purchase Program and Community Development Capital Initiative. This will be the last set of financial statements produced for TARP as there is no longer a legal requirement to produce future financial statements (12 U.S.C. § 5226(e)).

This page provides general background and information on the housing programs established by Treasury under TARP. The MHA program expired on December 31, 2016.Consumer Fraud AlertIn the beginning of 2009, the U.S. economy was facing the fallout from a housing bubble that by some measures had doubled home prices in a period of six years. By the time the Obama Administration took office in January 2009, home prices had fallen for 30 straight months. Home values had fallen by nearly one-third. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been in conservatorship for four months, and American families were struggling to buy and keep their homes.In February 2009, President Obama announced a number of steps to strengthen the housing market and help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. As part of this broad response to the housing crisis, Treasury, under TARP, established two central programs, Making Home Affordable® (MHA) and the Hardest Hit Fund® (HHF).In December 2016, the Making Home Affordable (MHA) program expired. Although this resource is no longer available to homeowners, help is still available. Mortgage companies will continue to offer assistance. Contact your mortgage company or lender directly to inquire about available solutions.Key FactsTreasury, under TARP, launched Making Home Affordable® (MHA), to provide mortgage relief to homeowners and prevent avoidable foreclosures.The cornerstone of MHA was the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP®), which permanently reduced mortgage payments to affordable levels for qualifying borrowers. MHA expanded to include a number of other specialized programs.Treasury also introduced the Hardest Hit Fund® (HHF), which helps those states hardest hit by home price declines and high unemployment to develop locally-tailored foreclosure prevention solutions.Treasury's programs are part of a wider government response designed to help homeowners, preserve communities, and keep mor",,,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/291/treasury-preview-1900x950.jpg,article,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,en,,False,False,True,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,True,200.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner"",""usa-form-group"",""usa-label""]",True,25.0,4.0,20.0,,0.0,109.0

This page provides general background and information on the housing programs established by Treasury under TARP. The MHA program expired on December 31, 2016.Consumer Fraud AlertIn the beginning of 2009, the U.S. economy was facing the fallout from a housing bubble that by some measures had doubled home prices in a period of six years. By the time the Obama Administration took office in January 2009, home prices had fallen for 30 straight months. Home values had fallen by nearly one-third. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been in conservatorship for four months, and American families were struggling to buy and keep their homes.In February 2009, President Obama announced a number of steps to strengthen the housing market and help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.

Contact your mortgage company or lender directly to inquire about available solutions.Key FactsTreasury, under TARP, launched Making Home Affordable® (MHA), to provide mortgage relief to homeowners and prevent avoidable foreclosures.The cornerstone of MHA was the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP®), which permanently reduced mortgage payments to affordable levels for qualifying borrowers. MHA expanded to include a number of other specialized programs.Treasury also introduced the Hardest Hit Fund® (HHF), which helps those states hardest hit by home price declines and high unemployment to develop locally-tailored foreclosure prevention solutions.Treasury's programs are part of a wider government response designed to help homeowners, preserve communities, and keep mor",,,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/291/treasury-preview-1900x950.jpg,article,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,en,,False,False,True,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,True,200.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner"",""usa-form-group"",""usa-label""]",True,25.0,4.0,20.0,,0.0,109.0

This page provides general background and information on the housing programs established by Treasury under TARP. The MHA program expired on December 31, 2016.Consumer Fraud AlertIn the beginning of 2009, the U.S. economy was facing the fallout from a housing bubble that by some measures had doubled home prices in a period of six years. By the time the Obama Administration took office in January 2009, home prices had fallen for 30 straight months. Home values had fallen by nearly one-third. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been in conservatorship for four months, and American families were struggling to buy and keep their homes.In February 2009, President Obama announced a number of steps to strengthen the housing market and help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. As part of this broad response to the housing crisis, Treasury, under TARP, established two central programs, Making Home Affordable® (MHA) and the Hardest Hit Fund® (HHF).In December 2016, the Making Home Affordable (MHA) program expired. Although this resource is no longer available to homeowners, help is still available. Mortgage companies will continue to offer assistance. Contact your mortgage company or lender directly to inquire about available solutions.Key FactsTreasury, under TARP, launched Making Home Affordable® (MHA), to provide mortgage relief to homeowners and prevent avoidable foreclosures.The cornerstone of MHA was the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP®), which permanently reduced mortgage payments to affordable levels for qualifying borrowers. MHA expanded to include a number of other specialized programs.Treasury also introduced the Hardest Hit Fund® (HHF), which helps those states hardest hit by home price declines and high unemployment to develop locally-tailored foreclosure prevention solutions.Treasury's programs are part of a wider government response designed to help homeowners, preserve communities, and keep mor",,,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/291/treasury-preview-1900x950.jpg,article,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,en,,False,False,True,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,True,200.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner"",""usa-form-group"",""usa-label""]",True,25.0,4.0,20.0,,0.0,109.0

Of that, the following amounts were committed through TARP's five program areas:Approximately $250 billion was committed in programs to stabilize banking institutions ($5 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).Approximately $27 billion was committed through programs to restart credit markets.Approximately $82 billion was committed to stabilize the U.S. auto industry ($2 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).Approximately $70 billion was committed to stabilize American International Group (AIG) ($2 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).Approximately $46 billion was committed for programs to help struggling families avoid foreclosure, with these expenditures being made over time.The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established OFS within the Office of Domestic Finance at the Department of the Treasury to implement TARP. OFS was not envisioned as a permanent organization. The authority to make new commitments through TARP ended October 3, 2010, at which time Treasury shifted focus to the orderly wind-down of TARP. As of September 30, 2023, all TARP programs have closed, and there are no remaining troubled assets held by OFS. During fiscal year 2023, OFS completed the wind down of its remaining housing programs under TARP and sold its last troubled assets from the Capital Purchase Program and Community Development Capital Initiative. This will be the last set of financial statements produced for TARP as there is no longer a legal requirement to produce future financial statements (12 U.S.C. § 5226(e)). OFS is also dissolving as an entity with only administrative functions remaining.

This page provides general background and information on the housing programs established by Treasury under TARP. The MHA program expired on December 31, 2016.Consumer Fraud AlertIn the beginning of 2009, the U.S. economy was facing the fallout from a housing bubble that by some measures had doubled home prices in a period of six years. By the time the Obama Administration took office in January 2009, home prices had fallen for 30 straight months. Home values had fallen by nearly one-third. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been in conservatorship for four months, and American families were struggling to buy and keep their homes.In February 2009, President Obama announced a number of steps to strengthen the housing market and help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. As part of this broad response to the housing crisis, Treasury, under TARP, established two central programs, Making Home Affordable® (MHA) and the Hardest Hit Fund® (HHF).In December 2016, the Making Home Affordable (MHA) program expired. Although this resource is no longer available to homeowners, help is still available. Mortgage companies will continue to offer assistance. Contact your mortgage company or lender directly to inquire about available solutions.Key FactsTreasury, under TARP, launched Making Home Affordable® (MHA), to provide mortgage relief to homeowners and prevent avoidable foreclosures.The cornerstone of MHA was the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP®), which permanently reduced mortgage payments to affordable levels for qualifying borrowers. MHA expanded to include a number of other specialized programs.Treasury also introduced the Hardest Hit Fund® (HHF), which helps those states hardest hit by home price declines and high unemployment to develop locally-tailored foreclosure prevention solutions.Treasury's programs are part of a wider government response designed to help homeowners, preserve communities, and keep mor",,,https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/291/treasury-preview-1900x950.jpg,article,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,en,,False,False,True,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-assets-relief-program/housing,True,200.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner"",""usa-form-group"",""usa-label""]",True,25.0,4.0,20.0,,0.0,109.0
