Facilities-based providers of broadband service report Form 477 data in June and December each year. Providers report fixed-broadband deployment data at the census block level. Form 477 data are reported using 2010 Census blocks. Providers may not offer service to every home in every block in which they report service. The calculations used to create the graphs treat every location as having service, and may therefore over-estimate broadband coverage, particularly in areas with large census blocks.",,,https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/social-media-sharing-fcc-logo.jpg,website,https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/,https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/,en,,True,False,False,https://broadband477map.fcc.gov/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,False,https://broadband477map.fcc.gov/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0
