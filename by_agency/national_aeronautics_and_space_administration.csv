The Office of Technology Transfer at JPL (OTT at JPL) specifically aims to focus on JPL intellectual property management and licensing, and commercialization support to apply JPL space technologies to non-NASA needs. The end goal is to infuse JPL-invented innovations into the private sector as quickly as possible so that taxpayers may benefit from NASA and JPL research, and so that the United States retains its technological leadership in world markets. The Office of Technology Transfer at JPL is responsible for new technology reporting, NASA Tech Briefs, software release, patents, licensing, and commercialization as these activities relate to JPL-developed technologies.",,,,website,https://ott.jpl.nasa.gov/,https://ott.jpl.nasa.gov/,,,True,False,True,https://ott.jpl.nasa.gov/error,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://ott.jpl.nasa.gov/error,True,200.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0
