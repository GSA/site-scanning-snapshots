Glory was lost in a launch vehicle failure on March 4, 2011. The 'A-Train' satellites cross the equator within a few minutes of each other at around 1:30 p.m. local time. By combining different sets of nearly simultaneous observations from these satellites, scientists are able to study important parameters related to climate change.","a-train, atrain, earth science, earth sciences, Goddard, NASA, GSFC, Goddard Space Flight Center, Earth, Science Reasearch, Climate, atmospheric measurement, numerical modeling, climate analysis, atmospheric radiation",,,,,,,,,en,,False,False,False,https://atrain.nasa.gov/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,False,https://atrain.nasa.gov/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0
