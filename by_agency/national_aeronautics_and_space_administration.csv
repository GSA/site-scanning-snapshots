Years covered: 1992 to the present.  1992-2021 records were originally on the JPL Technical Report Server (TRS) on Dspace system; those records were migrated to Dataverse in 2022.  Records with publication date 2022 or later are native to the Dataverse. Data sets: 2022 to present There are a few pre-1992 records. Those were added to the system on a case-by-case request basis.  Persistent IDs (PIDs): 1992-2021 records have Handles 2022 and later records have Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).",,,,,,,,,,en,,False,True,False,https://dataverse.jpl.nasa.gov/robots.txt,True,200.0,text/plain,211.0,,,False,False,https://dataverse.jpl.nasa.gov/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0
