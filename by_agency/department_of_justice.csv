was established in 1974, to provide tactical intelligence to federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies on a national scale.  EPIC’s mission is to support U.S. law enforcement (LE) through the timely analysis and dissemination of intelligence on threats to the Nation and those criminal organizations responsible for illegal activities within the Western Hemisphere, having a particular emphasis on  the Southwest Border.  While taking a hemispheric, all crimes/all threats view, EPIC’s primary focus is on criminal activity within the United States.  Today, EPIC is an all-threats center that leverages the authorities and expertise of its partners to deliver informed intelligence.  EPIC offers tactical, operational and strategic intelligence support to Federal, State, local, tribal, and international law enforcement organizations.  The center provides access to LE systems with the opportunity to collaborate daily through exchanges with LE analysts and operators, as well as routine engagement with our Federal, State, local, tribal, and international partners.  The key to EPIC’s success is a culture that transcends parochialism.  EPIC is a team approach.  Collectively, we deter threats and protect our nation. ",,,https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/usdea_logo.png,page,https://www.dea.gov/what-we-do/law-enforcement/epic,https://www.dea.gov/what-we-do/law-enforcement/epic,en,en,True,False,True,https://www.dea.gov/what-we-do/law-enforcement/epic,True,200.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.dea.gov/what-we-do/law-enforcement/epic,True,200.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner"",""usa-overlay"",""usa-skipnav""]",True,20.0,3.0,20.0,v3.9.0,100.0,203.0

On December 16, 2016 a Canadian jury convicted John Boulachanis, 42, of first degree murder. In 1997, Boulachanis murdered Robert Tanguay, 32, in Riguad, Quebec, Canada, and then lived as an international fugitive under various aliases in Canada and the United States for over a decade. During this time he was sought by Canadian authorities and was the subject of an INTERPOL Red Notice. Boulachanis remained out of sight for years until Canada’s INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Ottawa asked INTERPOL Washington to assist in the cold fugitive case because of new leads developed in Quebec. To break this case, investigators in Canada and the United States shared and disseminated lead information between the two INTERPOL NCBs, and used all resources available to Canadian and U.S. investigators in a concerted effort to locate and apprehend Boulachanis. For the United States, INTERPOL Washington served as a centralized information repository in the effort to assist Canadian law enforcement with the location and capture of the fugitive in June 2011.

On December 16, 2016 a Canadian jury convicted John Boulachanis, 42, of first degree murder. In 1997, Boulachanis murdered Robert Tanguay, 32, in Riguad, Quebec, Canada, and then lived as an international fugitive under various aliases in Canada and the United States for over a decade. During this time he was sought by Canadian authorities and was the subject of an INTERPOL Red Notice. Boulachanis remained out of sight for years until Canada’s INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Ottawa asked INTERPOL Washington to assist in the cold fugitive case because of new leads developed in Quebec. To break this case, investigators in Canada and the United States shared and disseminated lead information between the two INTERPOL NCBs, and used all resources available to Canadian and U.S. investigators in a concerted effort to locate and apprehend Boulachanis. For the United States, INTERPOL Washington served as a centralized information repository in the effort to assist Canadian law enforcement with the location and capture of the fugitive in June 2011. INTERPOL Washington reviewed historical records and conducted analysis related to the fugitive and his aliases and collected information from U.S. law enforcement agencies which assisted in Boulachanis’ apprehension in Canada. The apprehension of Boulachanis was the result of outstanding cooperation and collaboration by INTERPOL Washington; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office (Florida); the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office (Virginia); Surete du Quebec – Canada, Major Crimes Unit; and INTERPOL Ottawa.

DEA is committed to making our communities safer and healthier, and we can do this by reducing overdoses and overdose deaths. While the community does its part to turn in unneeded medications and remove them from potential harm, we are doing our part to further reduce drug-related violence. On this webpage are resources to help you dispose of unneeded medications in your home, seek treatment for a substance use disorder and learn more about the drug overdose epidemic in the United States.",,,https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2021-04/usdea_logo.png,page,https://www.dea.gov/takebackday,https://www.dea.gov/takebackday,en,en,True,False,True,https://www.dea.gov/takebackday/robots.txt,False,404.0,text/html,,,,False,True,https://www.dea.gov/takebackday/sitemap.xml,False,404.0,text/html,,,,20.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,"[""usa-accordion"",""usa-banner"",""usa-header"",""usa-hero"",""usa-logo"",""usa-menu-btn"",""usa-overlay"",""usa-skipnav""]",True,45.0,3.0,20.0,v3.9.0,100.0,228.0
