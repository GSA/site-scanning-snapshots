On December 16, 2016 a Canadian jury convicted John Boulachanis, 42, of first degree murder. In 1997, Boulachanis murdered Robert Tanguay, 32, in Riguad, Quebec, Canada, and then lived as an international fugitive under various aliases in Canada and the United States for over a decade. During this time he was sought by Canadian authorities and was the subject of an INTERPOL Red Notice. Boulachanis remained out of sight for years until Canada‚Äôs INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Ottawa asked INTERPOL Washington to assist in the cold fugitive case because of new leads developed in Quebec. To break this case, investigators in Canada and the United States shared and disseminated lead information between the two INTERPOL NCBs, and used all resources available to Canadian and U.S. investigators in a concerted effort to locate and apprehend Boulachanis. For the United States, INTERPOL Washington served as a centralized information repository in the effort to assist Canadian law enforcement with the location and capture of the fugitive in June 2011. INTERPOL Washington reviewed historical records and conducted analysis related to the fugitive and his aliases and collected information from U.S. law enforcement agencies which assisted in Boulachanis‚Äô apprehension in Canada. The apprehension of Boulachanis was the result of outstanding cooperation and collaboration by INTERPOL Washington; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Pinellas County Sheriff‚Äôs Office (Florida); the Franklin County Sheriff‚Äôs Office (Virginia); Surete du Quebec ‚Äì Canada, Major Crimes Unit; and INTERPOL Ottawa. A component of the U.S. Department of Justice, INTERPOL Washington is co-managed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

On December 16, 2016 a Canadian jury convicted John Boulachanis, 42, of first degree murder. In 1997, Boulachanis murdered Robert Tanguay, 32, in Riguad, Quebec, Canada, and then lived as an international fugitive under various aliases in Canada and the United States for over a decade. During this time he was sought by Canadian authorities and was the subject of an INTERPOL Red Notice. Boulachanis remained out of sight for years until Canada‚Äôs INTERPOL National Central Bureau (NCB) in Ottawa asked INTERPOL Washington to assist in the cold fugitive case because of new leads developed in Quebec. To break this case, investigators in Canada and the United States shared and disseminated lead information between the two INTERPOL NCBs, and used all resources available to Canadian and U.S. investigators in a concerted effort to locate and apprehend Boulachanis. For the United States, INTERPOL Washington served as a centralized information repository in the effort to assist Canadian law enforcement with the location and capture of the fugitive in June 2011. INTERPOL Washington reviewed historical records and conducted analysis related to the fugitive and his aliases and collected information from U.S. law enforcement agencies which assisted in Boulachanis‚Äô apprehension in Canada. The apprehension of Boulachanis was the result of outstanding cooperation and collaboration by INTERPOL Washington; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Pinellas County Sheriff‚Äôs Office (Florida); the Franklin County Sheriff‚Äôs Office (Virginia); Surete du Quebec ‚Äì Canada, Major Crimes Unit; and INTERPOL Ottawa.
