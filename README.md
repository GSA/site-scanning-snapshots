## Site Scanning Snapshots

A storage facility for one-off scan data.

The [Site Scanning program](https://digital.gov/site-scanning/) automates a wide range of scans of public federal websites and generates data about website health and best practices.

This repository serves as a storage facility for one-off scan snapshots and automated monthly program snapshots.   

To ask a question or leave feedback for the program, please [file an issue here](https://github.com/GSA/site-scanning/issues) or email us at site-scanning@gsa.gov.
