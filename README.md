# Site Scanning Snapshots
A storage facility for one off scan data.


The [Site Scanning program](https://digital.gov/site-scanning/) automates a wide range of scans of public federal websites and generates data about website health and best practices.

This repository serves as a storage facility for one-off scan snapshots and automated monthly program snapshots.
